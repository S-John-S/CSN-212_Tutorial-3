    This directory contains source code for data structures which
    implement balanced binary trees (red-black trees) and interval trees.
    The main source code files are:
    
    RedBlackTree.h, RedBlackTree.cc
    interval_tree.cc, interval_tree.h

    These files depend on:

    misc.h (miscellaneous stuff like safe version of malloc + assert macro)
    TemplateStack.H (array based stacks via templates)

    The other files are used to run regression tests.  gmake test runs
    all the current regression tests and reports the results.


  The minimum functions are listed as follows int he header files:-

  Interval * DeleteNode(IntervalTreeNode *);
  IntervalTreeNode * Insert(Interval *);
  /*IntervalTreeNode * Search(Interval *);*/
  /*this function is executed in the enumeration as multiple outputs of*/
  /*overlaps in the function parameters*/
